# Specification Quality Checklist: Next.js Dashboard Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-12
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *[Note: Implementation details included as they are core requirements for this Migration task]*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) *[Note: Tech-specific criteria included for migration verification]*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification *[See Note above]*

## Notes

- This is a technical migration feature. The "Business Goal" is the re-platforming to Next.js. Therefore, technical constraints (Next.js, Tailwind, App Router) are treated as Functional Requirements.
- Validation passed with exceptions noted for technical specificity.
